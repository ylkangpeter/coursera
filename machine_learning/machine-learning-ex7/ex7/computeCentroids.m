function centroids = computeCentroids(X, idx, K)
%COMPUTECENTROIDS returns the new centroids by computing the means of the 
%data points assigned to each centroid.
%   centroids = COMPUTECENTROIDS(X, idx, K) returns the new centroids by 
%   computing the means of the data points assigned to each centroid. It is
%   given a dataset X where each row is a single data point, a vector
%   idx of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K]) for each
%   example, and K, the number of centroids. You should return a matrix
%   centroids, where each row of centroids is the mean of the data points
%   assigned to it.
%

% Useful variables
[m n] = size(X);
% K
% idx
% X
% You need to return the following variables correctly.
centroids = zeros(K, n);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Go over every centroid and compute mean of all points that
%               belong to it. Concretely, the row vector centroids(i, :)
%               should contain the mean of the data points assigned to
%               centroid i.
%
% Note: You can use a for-loop over the centroids to compute this.
%

for i=1:K
	points = find(idx==i);
	k = size(points,1);
	% val=zeros(1,size(centroids,1));
	for j=1:size(points,1)
		% points(j)
		% X
		% X(points(j),:)
		centroids(i,:) = centroids(i,:) + X(points(j),:);
	end
	centroids(i,:) = centroids(i,:)/k;
